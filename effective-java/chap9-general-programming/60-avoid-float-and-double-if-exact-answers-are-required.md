Avoiding `float` and `double` in Java when exact answers are required is a best practice, especially for financial calculations, due to their inherent imprecision in representing decimal numbers.

1. **BigDecimal** : Provides arbitrary-precision decimal numbers and is designed for precise arithmetic operations.

        BigDecimal difference = amount1.subtract(amount2);

        System.out.println("Correct difference using BigDecimal: " + difference);
    }
}
```

Output:

```arduino
Correct difference using BigDecimal: 1.05
```

Considerations When Using `BigDecimal`

- **String Constructor** : Always use the `BigDecimal(String)` constructor to avoid precision issues caused by the `double` constructor.

- **Immutable** : `BigDecimal` instances are immutable; methods like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` return new `BigDecimal` objects.

- **Scale and Rounding** : When performing division, you often need to specify the scale and rounding mode to avoid `ArithmeticException`.
  Example 2: Using `int` or `long` for Fixed-Point Arithmetic**Representing Monetary Values in Cents** :

```java
public class FixedPointExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int amount1 = 215; // 2.15 dollars represented in cents
        int amount2 = 110; // 1.10 dollars represented in cents
        int difference = amount1 - amount2;

        System.out.println("Difference using fixed-point arithmetic: " + (difference / 100.0));
    }
}
```

Output:

```arduino
Difference using fixed-point arithmetic: 1.05
```

### Summary of Best Practices

1. **Use `BigDecimal`** :

- For calculations requiring precise decimal representation and arithmetic, especially financial calculations.

- When exact results are critical and rounding errors are unacceptable.

2. **Use `int` or `long` for Fixed-Point Arithmetic** :

- When dealing with quantities that can be represented as whole numbers, such as monetary values in cents.

- For performance-sensitive applications where the overhead of `BigDecimal` is too high.

3. **Avoid `float` and `double`** :

- For exact arithmetic operations where precision is crucial.

- In financial applications, measurements, and calculations involving currency.

### Conclusion

In Java, avoiding `float` and `double` for exact arithmetic operations is essential to prevent precision errors. Instead, use `BigDecimal` for arbitrary-precision arithmetic and `int` or `long` for fixed-point arithmetic when dealing with exact values. By following these practices, you can ensure the accuracy and reliability of your numerical computations.
