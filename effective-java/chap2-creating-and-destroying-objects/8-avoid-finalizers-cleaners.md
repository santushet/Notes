Avoiding finalizers and cleaners in Java is recommended due to their unpredictability and performance issues. Instead, prefer using try-with-resources and explicit resource management.

### Why Avoid Finalizers?

1. **Unpredictability** : Finalizers can be executed long after the object becomes eligible for garbage collection, making their timing unpredictable.

2. **Performance** : The finalization process can impact performance because objects with finalizers require at least two garbage collection cycles to be reclaimed.

3. **Reliability** : There's no guarantee that the finalizer will run. For example, if the JVM terminates abruptly, finalizers may not execute.

### Why Avoid Cleaners?

While `java.lang.ref.Cleaner` introduced in Java 9 is more predictable and less problematic than finalizers, it still involves non-deterministic behavior and can be avoided for similar reasons.

### Preferred Alternatives

1. **Try-with-Resources (AutoCloseable)**

2. **Explicit Resource Management**

### Example: Using Try-with-Resources

**AutoCloseable Resource:**

```java
public class Resource implements AutoCloseable {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Using the resource");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource has been closed");
    }
}
```

**Using Try-with-Resources:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Resource resource = new Resource()) {
            resource.doSomething();
        } // The resource is automatically closed here
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **AutoCloseable Implementation** : The `Resource` class implements `AutoCloseable` and overrides the `close()` method to define resource cleanup logic.

2. **Try-with-Resources Statement** : In the `main` method, the resource is used within a try-with-resources statement. This ensures that the `close()` method is called automatically when the try block exits, whether normally or due to an exception.

### Example: Explicit Resource Management

**Explicit Resource Management Class:**

```java
public class ManualResource {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Resource opened");
    }

    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Resource in use");
    }

    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed");
    }
}
```

**Using Explicit Resource Management:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ManualResource resource = new ManualResource();
        try {
            resource.open();
            resource.use();
        } finally {
            resource.close(); // Ensure the resource is closed
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Manual Resource Management** : The `ManualResource` class has `open()`, `use()`, and `close()` methods for managing the resource lifecycle.

2. **Try-Finally Block** : In the `main` method, the resource is opened and used within a try block. The `close()` method is called in the finally block to ensure the resource is closed even if an exception occurs.

### Summary

- **Avoid Finalizers** : Unpredictable, performance impact, and reliability issues.

- **Avoid Cleaners** : While better than finalizers, still non-deterministic.

- **Preferred Alternatives** :

  - **Try-with-Resources** : Use this pattern for resources that implement `AutoCloseable` or `Closeable`.

  - **Explicit Resource Management** : Use try-finally blocks to ensure resources are properly closed.

By following these practices, you can ensure more reliable and efficient resource management in your Java applications.
