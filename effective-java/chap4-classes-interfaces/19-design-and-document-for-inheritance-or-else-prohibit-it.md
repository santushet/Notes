Designing for inheritance or explicitly prohibiting it is crucial for creating a clear and maintainable class hierarchy in object-oriented programming. When designing a class, it's important to make intentional decisions about whether it should be extended by other classes. If a class is intended to be a base class, it should be designed with extension in mind. If not, inheritance should be prohibited to prevent misuse.

### Designing for Inheritance

When designing a class for inheritance, follow these guidelines:

1. **Document the Class** : Clearly document the class's intended use and how it should be extended.

2. **Provide Protected Constructors and Methods** : Use protected constructors and methods to allow subclasses to access necessary functionality.

3. **Use Abstract Classes** : Consider using abstract classes for base classes to provide a clear template for subclasses.

4. **Follow the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** : Ensure that subclasses can be used interchangeably with the base class without altering the desired behavior of the program.

5. **Design for Extension, Not Modification** : Design the class so that its behavior can be extended without modifying its code.

### Example: Designing a Class for Inheritance

Let's design an abstract class `Shape` intended to be extended by specific shape classes.**Shape.java:**

```java
/**
 * Abstract base class for different shapes.
 * Subclasses should implement the abstract methods to define specific shapes.
 */
public abstract class Shape {
    private String color;

    protected Shape(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    /**
     * Calculate the area of the shape.
     * This method must be implemented by subclasses.
     *
     * @return the area of the shape
     */
    public abstract double calculateArea();

    /**
     * Calculate the perimeter of the shape.
     * This method must be implemented by subclasses.
     *
     * @return the perimeter of the shape
     */
    public abstract double calculatePerimeter();
}
```

**Circle.java:**

```java
/**
 * Represents a circle.
 */
public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(String color, double radius) {
        super(color);
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculatePerimeter() {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
}
```

**Rectangle.java:**

```java
/**
 * Represents a rectangle.
 */
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(String color, double length, double width) {
        super(color);
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculatePerimeter() {
        return 2 * (length + width);
    }
}
```

### Prohibiting Inheritance

To explicitly prohibit inheritance, follow these guidelines:

1. **Make the Class Final** : Use the `final` keyword to prevent the class from being subclassed.

2. **Private Constructors** : Use private constructors if the class should not be instantiated or extended.

3. **Document the Class** : Clearly document that the class is not intended for inheritance.

### Example: Prohibiting Inheritance

Let's design a class `Utility` that should not be extended.**Utility.java:**

```java
/**
 * Utility class containing static helper methods.
 * This class is not meant to be extended.
 */
public final class Utility {

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Utility() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Utility class cannot be instantiated");
    }

    /**
     * Calculate the maximum of two integers.
     *
     * @param a the first integer
     * @param b the second integer
     * @return the maximum of a and b
     */
    public static int max(int a, int b) {
        return (a > b) ? a : b;
    }

    /**
     * Calculate the minimum of two integers.
     *
     * @param a the first integer
     * @param b the second integer
     * @return the minimum of a and b
     */
    public static int min(int a, int b) {
        return (a < b) ? a : b;
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Whether designing a class for inheritance or explicitly prohibiting it, it's crucial to be intentional and clear about your design decisions. By documenting your intentions, using appropriate access modifiers, and following best practices, you can create a maintainable and understandable class hierarchy that meets your application's needs.

- **Designing for Inheritance** : Use abstract classes, protected methods, and clear documentation to guide subclass implementations.

- **Prohibiting Inheritance** : Use the `final` keyword, private constructors, and documentation to prevent misuse and unintended extension.

By following these principles, you ensure that your classes are used as intended, leading to more robust and maintainable code.
