In "Effective Java," Joshua Bloch strongly advises against using raw types with generics. Generics were introduced in Java to provide stronger type checks at compile time and to support generic programming. Using raw types negates the benefits that generics provide and can lead to various problems, including runtime errors that could have been caught at compile time.

### What Are Raw Types?

Raw types are the names of generic classes or interfaces without any type parameters. For example, if you have a generic class `List<E>`, using `List` without a type parameter is using a raw type.

### Why Avoid Raw Types?

1. **Lack of Type Safety** : Raw types bypass the generic type system, which means you lose the compile-time type checking. This can lead to runtime `ClassCastException`.

2. **Loss of Expressiveness** : Generics make your code more expressive and self-documenting by explicitly stating what types a class or method operates on.

3. **Backward Compatibility** : Raw types are supported primarily for backward compatibility with older versions of Java that did not support generics. Modern code should avoid them.

4. **Generic APIs** : Using raw types can lead to less readable and less maintainable code, as you miss out on the benefits of the generic API's type information.

### Example and Explanation

Let's consider an example to illustrate the problems with raw types and how using generics can solve these issues.

#### Using Raw Types

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class RawTypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List rawList = new ArrayList();  // Raw type
        rawList.add("Hello");
        rawList.add(123);  // Mixing types is possible

        for (Object obj : rawList) {
            String str = (String) obj;  // ClassCastException at runtime
            System.out.println(str);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `rawList` is declared as a raw `List`. This allows adding elements of any type, leading to potential runtime errors. The cast to `String` can fail with a `ClassCastException` if the list contains elements that are not `String`.

#### Using Generics

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GenericTypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();  // Parameterized type
        stringList.add("Hello");
        // stringList.add(123);  // Compile-time error

        for (String str : stringList) {
            System.out.println(str);  // No cast needed, safe
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `stringList` is a `List` parameterized with `String`. The compiler ensures that only `String` elements can be added to the list, preventing the possibility of a `ClassCastException`. The code is safer and more readable since no casting is required when retrieving elements.

### Guidelines for Using Generics

1. **Use Parameterized Types** : Always use parameterized types (e.g., `List<String>`) instead of raw types (e.g., `List`).

2. **Leverage Type Inference** : Use the diamond operator (`<>`) to let the compiler infer the type parameters.

3. **Generic Methods** : When writing methods, use generics to make the methods more flexible and type-safe.

4. **Type Parameters** : Use bounded type parameters to enforce constraints on the types that can be used with generics.

5. **Avoid Mixing Raw and Generic Types** : Mixing raw and parameterized types can lead to confusing and unsafe code.

### Conclusion

Avoiding raw types in favor of generics is a best practice that enhances type safety, readability, and maintainability of your code. Generics provide compile-time type checking, reducing the risk of runtime errors and making your APIs clearer and more expressive. By following these guidelines and embracing generics, you can write more robust and reliable Java code.
